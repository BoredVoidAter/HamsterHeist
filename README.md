# HamsterHeist: The Ultimate Rodent Robotics Rumble!

Welcome to the official repository for HamsterHeist! We're thrilled you're here to check out our project.

## What is HamsterHeist?

HamsterHeist is a competitive, physics-based web game where players build and program tiny, autonomous hamster-bots to sneak through a complex digital maze and steal a coveted golden sunflower seed.

Players design their bot's physical chassis (affecting weight and traction) and then write simple, block-based or JavaScript code to control its logic and sensors for navigating traps, other bots, and dynamic obstacles. The core challenge lies in creating an AI that can adapt to changing environments and outsmart other players' creations in real-time, multiplayer heists.

It's a hilarious blend of robotics simulation, coding puzzles, and chaotic multiplayer fun!

## Features

Here are some of the core features we're building:

*   **Physics-Based World:** Every collision, tumble, and turn is governed by a realistic physics engine.
*   **Custom Bot Builder:** Design your hamster-bot's chassis. Will you build a nimble lightweight or a powerful tank?
*   **Dual Coding Modes:** Program your bot's AI using an intuitive block-based editor for beginners, or switch to raw JavaScript for full control.
*   **Sensor Suite:** Equip your bot with sensors to detect walls, traps, and rival bots.
*   **Dynamic Mazes:** No two heists are the same! Navigate ever-changing labyrinths filled with clever traps and obstacles.
*   **Real-Time Multiplayer:** Compete against other players' bots in frantic, winner-take-all heists.
